# Pulse.AI

This is a mock landing website for a fictional company called Pulse.AI. 
The website is a single page application that showcases the company's services, features, and contact information.

The key aspects of this website are:
- Use of a Prismic CMS to handle all content and allow for easy update and creation of components.
- Localization 
- Use of GSAP for modern animations and transitions.
- (Potentially) Use of Tailwind v4 unstable version to try out the new features.
